      <p>No speeches. Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name - Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square one. But you know the business and I know the chemistry. I'm thinking... maybe you and I could partner up. </p>

      <p>I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. So there's that. How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh? How are you even alive?</p>

      <p>That is seventeen five - your half of the thirty-five thousand. Plus there's an extra fifteen in there, it's all yours, you've earned it. We made a deal. That's right. Because I think that we can do business together - we came to an understanding. Take a look at the money in your hand. Now just imagine making that every week. That's right. Two pounds a week, thirty-five thousand a pound. </p>

      <p>What kind of man talks to the DEA? No man. No man at all. A crippled little rata. What a reputation to leave behind. Is that how you want to be remembered? Last chance to look at me, Hector. Can I help you sir? What can I do for you? I'm... sorry, I'm not following. I... think that you're confusing me for someone else. Sir, if you have a complaint, I suggest you submit it through our email system. I will be happy to refer you to our website. </p>

      <p>I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White. You are not a cautious man at all. Your partner was late and he was high. He's high often, isn't he? You have poor judgement. I can't work with someone with poor judgement. I've been told, it's excellent. That is not the only factor. I have to ask... why? Why him? How much product do you have on hand? I have your numbers. You can never trust a drug addict. </p>

      <p>Has your condition worsened? Your medical condition, has it grown worse? Is there a ringing in your ears? Are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices? No, clearly you are not. No rational person would do as you have done. Explain yourself. Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child? Where is Pinkman now. </p>
